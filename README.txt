Title: Towers of Hanoi

This program uses an applied implementation of the Linked List based Stack.

After creating a linked list based stack, the program prompts the user to participate
in a game of Towers of Hanoi. The game has the following restrictions:

    1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on
       top of another stack. In other words, a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost
       disk on a stack.
    3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
